FILES :-
 
1 CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

2 run_analysis.R performs cleaning of data and does following function
          
          1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
          2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
          3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
          4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
          5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity               and each subject.
3 FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
